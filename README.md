## Tech Stack

LangChain + LangGraph | GPT-4.1 | Gradio | SQLite

## Implementation

The projects involves the following steps:

### 1- Web Scrapping
Collected data about specs and prices of new cars in the egyptian market using webscrapping

### 2- Data procesing
Cleaned and processed the scrapped data.

### 3- Created teh Database
Created and optimized an SQLite Database where the information about the cars are stored

### 4- Chatbot
The Chatbot gets the user question, decide if it needs to access the database or the question requires only LLM general knowledge. If the question needs data from the database the LLm can access the database using a database tool. The LLM gets the results, formulate the response and give it back to the user.

The Chatbot uses LangChain/LangGraph agentic architecture with GPT-4.1 as the LLM.

### 5- Evaluation and Hyperparameter tuning
An Evaluation set was developed to evaluate the performance of the chatbot using LangSmith and a hyperparameter tuning for two parameters was performed.

### 6- User Interface
Created a user interface using Gradio
