## System Architecture

### Overview
The chatbot system follows a modular, component-based architecture designed for maintainability, scalability, and intelligent conversation handling. The system processes user queries through multiple specialized components that work together to provide accurate, contextual responses.

### Core Architecture Flow
```
User Input → CarChatbot (Orchestrator)
    ↓
    ├── ConversationManager (Memory & Context)
    ├── KnowledgeHandler (External Knowledge Check)
    │       ↓
    │   Unified get_knowledge_response() → GPT-4.1 → Response
    │
    └── Database Query Path:
        ├── QueryProcessor (NL → Criteria + SQL via GPT-4.1)
        ├── DatabaseHandler (Dual Execution System)
        │   ├── Primary: execute_query(AI-generated SQL) ✅
        │   └── Fallback: search_cars(criteria) ⚠️ (logged)
        └── ResponseGenerator (GPT-4.1 Response)
    ↓
Conversational Response → User
```

### Component Interaction Model
1. **CarChatbot** receives user input and orchestrates the entire flow
2. **ConversationManager** provides context and tracks user preferences
3. **KnowledgeHandler** determines if query needs external automotive knowledge
   - Simplified: Single `get_knowledge_response()` method handles all external queries
   - No rigid categorization - GPT-4.1 adapts response naturally
4. **QueryProcessor** converts natural language to both structured criteria AND SQL using GPT-4.1
5. **DatabaseHandler** executes queries using dual system:
   - **Primary**: AI-generated SQL (flexible, context-aware)
   - **Fallback**: Non-AI `search_cars()` with comprehensive logging when AI fails
6. **ResponseGenerator** creates conversational responses with intelligent clarification logic
7. **Configuration system** provides centralized model and prompt management
8. **Logging system** tracks AI failures, fallback usage, and system behavior

### Design Principles
- **Modular Components**: Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Centralized Configuration**: All LLM settings, prompts, and behavior controlled via YAML
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic detection of database vs. knowledge queries
- **Conversation Memory**: Tracks user preferences and conversation history
- **Egyptian Market Focus**: Specialized for local automotive market needs
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed logging tracks AI usage, fallbacks, and system behavior

## Key Features

### System Monitoring & Logging
**Comprehensive visibility into system behavior:**
- **AI Usage Tracking**: Logs when AI-generated SQL is successfully used
- **Fallback Monitoring**: Warning-level logs when non-AI fallback is triggered
  - Logs reason: No SQL generated vs. SQL failed validation

## Configuration System

### Centralized Configuration (`chatbot/chatbot_config.yaml`)
The entire chatbot behavior is controlled through a comprehensive YAML configuration file that enables easy customization without code changes.

#### OpenAI Configuration
```yaml
openai:
  model: "gpt-4.1"          # Centralized model selection
  temperature: 0.1          # Response randomness control
  max_tokens: 1000          # Response length limits
```

#### Conversation Settings
```yaml
conversation:
  max_history: 20           # Conversation memory depth
  greeting: |               # Custom welcome message
    Hi! I'm your AI car advisor for the Egyptian market...
```

#### Intelligent Prompts
- **System Prompt**: Defines AI behavior, capabilities, and clarification logic
- **Query Generation Prompt**: Instructions for natural language to SQL conversion
- **Response Generation Prompt**: Guidelines for conversational response creation
- **Clarification Logic**: Smart rules for when to ask questions vs. proceed with broad requests

#### Advanced Features

- Imports processed CSV data with 886 vehicles
- Creates performance indexes on key columns:
  - car_brand, car_model, car_trim, body_type
  - Price_EGP, Transmission_Type, Origin_Country, Engine_Turbo

#### Database Tester (`database/database_tester.py`)

## Advanced Chatbot Capabilities

### Intelligent Query Processing
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes complex queries like "crossovers under 2M EGP, non-Chinese, automatic with ESP"
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Understands variations like "under 2 million", "below 2M", "max 2,000,000 EGP"
- **Feature Recognition**: Maps user terms to database columns (e.g., "auto" → "automatic", "ESP" → safety feature)
- **Smart Defaults**: Handles broad requests like "random car under 800k" without excessive clarification

### LLM-Integrated Clarification System
**Previous Problem**: Rule-based system was too rigid, asking unnecessary clarification for clear requests
**Solution**: GPT-4.1 now intelligently decides when clarification is genuinely needed

**Examples of Smart Handling:**
- ✅ "Pick a random car under 800k" → Proceeds with diverse selection
- ✅ "Any good SUV" → Shows variety of SUVs with explanations
- ✅ "Surprise me with a budget car" → Selects diverse affordable options
- ❓ "I need a car" (no criteria) → Asks for budget and type
- ❓ "Good car" (extremely vague) → Requests specific requirements

### External Knowledge Integration
**Simplified, Unified Approach:**
The system now uses a single, flexible method that automatically handles all types of automotive knowledge queries without rigid categorization. GPT-4.1 naturally adapts its response to match the question type.

**Example Queries Handled:**
- **Reliability**: "Is the Toyota Camry reliable?" → Natural reliability analysis
- **Comparisons**: "Honda Civic vs Toyota Corolla" → Adaptive side-by-side comparison
- **Market Insights**: "What cars are popular in Egypt?" → Market trends and preferences
- **Historical Data**: "When was the BMW X5 first introduced?" → Brand and model history
- **Maintenance**: "Cost to maintain a BMW?" → Ownership cost analysis
- **Reviews**: "What do people think of the Hyundai Elantra?" → Balanced review summary
- **Safety**: "Is the Volvo XC90 safe?" → Safety ratings and features analysis

**Key Improvement**: Removed rigid category routing and specialized prompts. The system now flows conversation context and database information naturally to GPT-4.1, which intelligently determines the appropriate response format.

### Conversation Memory & Learning
- **Preference Tracking**: Learns user's budget patterns, body type preferences, feature requirements
- **Context Awareness**: References previous queries and maintains conversation flow
- **Session Statistics**: Tracks success rate, query patterns, and interaction quality
- **Adaptive Responses**: Adjusts recommendations based on learned preferences

### Egyptian Market Specialization

   - Ensure `database/cars.db` exists (run `python database/database_creator.py`)
   - Verify all dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

2. **Unicode/Encoding Errors**:
   - Fixed in current version (removed problematic emojis)
   - Windows console now supports the chatbot interface

3. **Database Issues**:
   - Permission denied: Close any database viewers
   - Missing table: Recreate database with `python database/database_creator.py`
   - No results: Check if processed_data.csv contains valid data

4. **GPT-4.1 API Issues**:
   - Rate limits: Built-in error handling with graceful fallbacks
   - Invalid API key: Update `.env` file with valid OpenAI API key
   - Token limits: System optimized to stay within reasonable token usage

### Debugging Commands
